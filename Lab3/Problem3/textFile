Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star Jimmy Butler left Friday night's 120-102 loss to the Houston Rockets with a right knee injury.
Butler drove into the paint with about three minutes remaining in the third quarter, missed a short jumper, but then clawed the rebound.
He dished to a teammate, then crumpled to the floor in pain, holding his knee.
