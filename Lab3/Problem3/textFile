In wins, these two have looked like national title contenders. In losses, well, we just aren't sure what to make of them. The only thing consistent about these teams has been inconsistency, and there's a good chance we really won't know who either is until the NCAA tournament.
Both are enigmas, but that isn't to say they aren't good teams. Good teams cross the 20-win threshold with ease; which they have. And good teams head into March as high seeds; which they will be. These are good teams; they're just different from the two teams we saw last season.
UNC has yet to convince us that it can stand on the same platform as the national championship-winning Heels from 2017, but consider that this team has just two more losses than last season's team had at this point. Maybe the team that almost swept February is the real UNC of the 2017-18 season. Another win over Duke could give the Heels a much better sense of their own identity going into the ACC tournament and beyond.
Duke has to figure out how it wants to play, and it has to do so right now. More importantly, the Blue Devils have to figure out whether they're a better team without star freshman forward Marvin Bagley.
Yes, it sounds crazy when you consider that Bagley is projected to be a lottery pick in this year's NBA draft, but small ball without Bagley led to four straight wins for Duke. His return resulted in the Blue Devils scoring their second- and third-fewest points of the season, including in this week's loss to Virginia Tech.
Duke has found its defensive footing with its zone, but the other end of the floor is a total question mark at this point for us, and probably for the Blue Devils themselves.
Both of these teams are as far as can be from the bubble, but their true identities remain a mystery. Saturday is a chance for Duke and UNC to point themselves in the right direction as the season continues to shorten.
Other teams to watch this weekend.
